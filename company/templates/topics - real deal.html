Using that example, there are many reasons you might choose to save your file in an email such as easier access, sharability, and relabiliy.

				   <p class="font-weight-bold">Why it exsists: </p>
				     <ul style="margin-top:-10px;">Starting with the public and hybrid cloud offerings, companies might use different cloud services for their different application needs. As with any industry, product offerings may be the same at face value but there are nuances that may speak to you..the cloud is no different. However, managing the different systems is difficult since the IT team needs to learn the different tools. This product line aims to simplify that process by letting a company operate all of their public and hybrid clouds with one solution.</ul>
				     <ul style="margin-top:-10px;">Operating a private cloud is different story. This means the company is usually responsible (they may contract all or some of it out) for all the different infrastructure pieces that make the cloud work.</ul>

						<p class="font-weight-bold">Private Cloud</p>
						  <ul>This means that the company using the cloud infrastructure is the only company using that infrastructure. The company can either own all the infrastrucure on-premises or they can be renting the infrasture from a third party. This allows for complete customization control as the company must decide on exactly how to configure the instructure and own the maintence process. The customization piece is mostly important for security and performance needs. Almost all production systems are run in a private cloud. This model is less-scalable than the public cloud since the infrastrucutre they need cannot be allocated on a moments notice.</ul>
				           	<p class="font-weight-bold">Public Cloud</p>
						  <ul>This means that the company using the cloud infrastructure is not the only company using those cloud devices (software/hardware). This provides companies with flexibility to scale-up and down with their instructure needs as they need it and puts the burden of maintaining the infrastrucutre on the cloud service provider. This is commonly used for less secure needs in the early stages of the development lifecycle.</ul>

This integrated solution uses software and x86 servers to replace expensive, purpose-built hardware. With hyperconverged infrastructure, you’ll decrease data center complexity and increase scalability.</ul>

				    <ul style="margin-top:-10px;">This product line is focused on:</ul>
					<ul style="margin-top:-10px;"> 1) Giving companies a single package to run and operate their data centers</ul>
				   <p class="font-weight-bold">Why it exsists: </p>
				     <ul style="margin-top:-10px;">Traditionally, when a company determines configuration options for their data center they have to determine four major caterogies:</ul>
					<ul style="margin-top:-10px;">1) What machines they want to use to store the data (storage)</ul>
					<ul style="margin-top:-10px;">2) The resourcing needs the storage machines need to have in order to meet business goals (compute)</ul>
					<ul style="margin-top:-10px;">3) How the data is going to be transfered between the machines and software applications (networking)</ul>
					<ul style="margin-top:-10px;">4) How the IT team is going to manage all of the above pieces (management)</ul>
				     <ul style="margin-top:-10px;">HCI simplifies those decisions by offering a solution that combines each of the four decisions above. HCI is a software defined data center meaning that companies can easily and cost effectively scale their growth for future needs.</ul>

Built on best-in-class VMware technologies — including VMware NSX, VMware SD-WAN by VeloCloud, and VMware vRealize Network Insight — Virtual Cloud Network connects and secures your apps and data across private, public, and edge/branch clouds with a scale-out approach that’s independent of underlying physical infrastructure.</ul>

				   <p class="font-weight-bold">Why it exsists: </p>
				     <ul style="margin-top:-10px;">When working with a traditional data center, the networking layer is how data is transferred between the different layers that make up the application. For physical data centers and non-cloud based applications, a company had to setup a network for each specific data center and application. As virtual data centers and cloud based applications become the norm, the networking is now able to be easily applied to all data centers and applications.</ul>

			           	<p class="font-weight-bold">Provision</p>
					  <ul>Provisioning is the process of setting up the development infrastructure. During this process, technical specifications (size, speed, etc.) for equipment and resourcing is determined. The final step is to make the new intracsture available to users and systems.</ul>
				        <p class="font-weight-bold">Kubernetes</p>
					  <ul>An open-source software used for container deployments.</ul>
			           	<p class="font-weight-bold">Containers</p>
					  <ul>A container is a piece of software that enables users to keep their work seperate from existing work. The container sits on top of the existing hardware allowing users to put multiple containers on a single piece of hardware. Containers are like Tupperware. Instead of having to purchase a new fridge for each meal you want to store, you store food in containers so it doesn't affect other food in the fridge. Software containers are no different. </ul>
			           	<p class="font-weight-bold">Microservices</p>
					  <ul>This is a software architecture design choice based on making an application as a collection of small services. Instead of having one major code base (often described as a monolith) that is responsible for the entire appliction, the application is split into logical sections (services) usually based on application function. </ul>
			           	<p class="font-weight-bold">Mesh Network</p>
					  <ul>This is a group of nodes configured to act as a single network. The grouping provides flexibility and redunancy if a node is not operating. The nodes can communicate via the internet but can also communicated via radio waves.</ul>
			           	<p class="font-weight-bold">Deployments</p>
					  <ul>The activities assocaited with making a software system available to end users</ul>
			           	<p class="font-weight-bold">Latency-Sensitive</p>
					  <ul>The amount of time between when you tell a system to do something and when the system does it. </ul>
			           	<p class="font-weight-bold">High-Volume </p>
					  <ul>In terms of data, high-volume is relative to the data being stored or tracked. For some applications, a high-volume of data could be gigabytes while for others high-volume could be terabytes. </ul>
			           	<p class="font-weight-bold">Mission-Critical</p>
					  <ul>These systems are required in order for the company to operate as usual. </ul>

					  <ul>This is an open-source message queuing platform.</ul>
			           	<p class="font-weight-bold">Message queuing</p>
					  <ul>When some software programs run, they generate messages which are used to start and end particular processes in the program. The types of messages can be anything from a progress output that a user can see in the UI to a process alerting it is finished and the next process should start.</ul>
			           	<p class="font-weight-bold">Protocol based</p>
					  <ul>Protocols are a systems of rules used to govern how different pieces of instrastructure are able to interact with each other.</ul>
			           	<p class="font-weight-bold">Scale</p>
					  <ul>In technical terms, this is the ability to easily adapt to more or less resourcing needs based on demand such as user counts or processing requests.</ul>
